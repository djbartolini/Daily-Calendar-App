## Description

The daily calendar app allows user to enter a reminder into each time slot, 9 to 5. If the save button is clicked, then the app will save the content on the text-enrty area into local storage, which will be retained on the page in case of refresh or if the page is revisited later. This way, the app can effectively serve as a reminder throughout your day.
